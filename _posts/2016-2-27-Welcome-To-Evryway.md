title: Welcome to Evryway!

Evryway is experimenting with virtual and augmented reality with one primary goal - to bring you and the world closer together.

Today's post is very much a "hello world" moment, while I get the basics of a communications channel up and running.
Over the next weeks, I'll be documenting Evryway's first prototype - a virtual mobile environment using Project Tango, Durovis Dive, Unity, spit and polish.

Although there may be a distinct lack of polish, at least for a while (and we all know that everything needs more polish!)

If you're interested in following along, drop me a mail!
