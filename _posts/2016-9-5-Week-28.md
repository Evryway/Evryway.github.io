My implementation of Chisel is coming along nicely. Most of the re-write work
is now done - this week I'm hoping to spend a bit of time taking depth frames
and point clouds from Tango and Kinect and start testing it out properly.

## Next week ...

Kids will be back to school this week and next week, so fingers crossed I'll be
ramping back up. Time to get some real work done!
