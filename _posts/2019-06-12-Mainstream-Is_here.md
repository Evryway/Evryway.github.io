## It's been a busy year ...

those of you who followed along with my Holodeck may have been wondering why everything went so quiet in 2018. The answer, as so often is the case, is hidden behind NDAs. hopefully I'll get a chance to talk about some of the projects at a later date. One thing I can say is that it's been a huge learning experience. Fitting consulting work around my family and lifestyle has been incredibly rewarding (and paying the bills is a bonus side effect!) but doesn't give me much room to enthuse about all the awesome things we're building.

One thing I can talk about, though, is my <b>[favourite new toy - the Oculus Quest.](https://www.oculus.com/quest/)</b> I'll be doing a short series of posts over the next week or two going into much more detail about how important this particular headset is going to be. For now, though, believe me when I say - I think this is the first true VR headset that will resonate with the general public. If they sell anything less than a million of these, I'll be very surprised.

Random prediction time - I think the Quest will be the headset with the largest user base by the end of 2020.

More details to come next week!
