## Quest is missing a music visualiser - so I made one.

I've been loving my beat saber machine, but sometimes I just want to chill and listen to some tunes. One thing that's lacking from
the Quest store (and Sidequest, as far as I can see) is a half-decent music visualiser - think Milkdrop but in VR.

So I made one.

## [Evryway Visualiser](https://evryway.itch.io/evryway-visualiser)

This is a super-early alpha "it's broken, whatchagonnado" build.

I have no idea whether I want to make it free, or charge for it - so currently there's a price on the Itch page (mostly to discourage
lots of people just downloading it and moaning at me about how broken it is). If you want to give it a try, email / tweet me and
I'll pop you a download key.

If anyone shows interest, I'll be putting in a lot more effects, and possibly some APIs for streaming music services like Spotify (if
I can figure out how to do it!)
