Realtime textured mesh into VR - It's working. Like all things @Evryway so far, it looks pretty rubbish and
there's a huge number of issues and potential improvements, but the first steps are always the most exciting.
Video below!

Apologies for the slow pace of updates this week, but I've basically been head down, guns blazing, trying
to get this working.

Dev blog update should be later today, where I'll cover what I've been doing.

As you can see from the video, I'm not quite capturing the camera pose correctly yet, projecting across
polygons that are angled away from the view vector looks rubbish, and there's lots of other little niggles,
but this is a wonderful starting place.

Maybe now I'll have time to catch up with what's been going on at GDC!
