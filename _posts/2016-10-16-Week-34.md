This week, I've done very little. Flatbuffers serialisation is working, chucking test data over the network
using Flatbuffers is working, and that's as far as I got.

On a plus note, I had some quality time with the boys this week ;)

## Next week ...

Hopefully, pointclouds via flatbuffers over the network. My fingers are crossed.
