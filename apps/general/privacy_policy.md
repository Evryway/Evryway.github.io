Evryway applications without a specific privacy policy should reference this policy directly.

Evryway applications may capture and store user-specific information such as app-specific
logins. This information will not be sent or otherwise broadcast from the device unless
legally required by a third party.

Evryway AR applications may use the device sensors, including camera and GPS, to determine
the location and orientation of the device. This information will not be sent or otherwise
broadcast from the device unless explicit approval is granted by the user in the application itself,
or legally required by a third party.

Evryway applications may have a debug mode which can be enabled by the user to allow for
logging and diagnostic information to be captured by the application. This information will
not be sent or otherwise broadcast from the device unless explicit approval is granted by
the user in the application itself, or legally required by a third party.

Evryway applications do not show adverts, use tracking identifiers, or any other mechanisms to
tie your device or your behaviour to a person or account. Your information is not for sale,
and you should never, as a user, be required to watch your own activity to keep your information
safe.

No information related to Evryway applications will be given to third parties, unless Evryway is
legally obligated to do so. I'll not be selling any of it, or using it for fame, power or glory.

Any information recieved from Evryway applications may be stored in persistent storage.
This information will be used only to enable the product to function, or to improve the
product, and can be deleted on request.

If you have any questions about this policy, or would like to request that any stored
information is deleted, please [email Evryway](mailto:hi@evryway.com).
