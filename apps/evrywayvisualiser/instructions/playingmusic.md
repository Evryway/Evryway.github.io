Once a track is on your Quest, you can select it from the Tracks menu.

If you're using controllers, Press the Menu button, and click on Tracks using the trigger.
If you're using hand tracking, make a thumbs-up with your left hand, wait for the
menu, then then click on Tracks using a pinch.

If you have MP3s on your Quest, you'll find them under Sources, Oculus Quest.
