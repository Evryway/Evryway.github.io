I've spent a day with my Vive, and it's time to do the inevitable "what's it like?" post. I thought
I'd put a bit more detail into how I'm finding the Rift too, as there's things to like about them
both, and a lot to learn.

## Which one is best?

Both of them, in different ways. This bodes well for the future, as the next generation
(coming 2019, you heard it here first) will undoubtedly bring a combination of all the
strong points.

#### That doesn't help me pick one!

Listen, if you haven't already got a pre-order in place, you're going to be waiting a good few months
anyway, and if you've already got a pre-order in, stick with it, whichever one it is. They're both
awesome.

## Comfort and ride

Both of them feel like you're looking at the world through a set of goggles (which you are). I've
spent a good deal of time with the DK1 and DK2, and now a week with the Rift and a day with the Vive.
None of the current generation magically transport you unless you let them, and for that to happen they
need to be comfortably sitting on your head/face, with the IPD adjusted correctly and the lenses lining
up nicely. I find that easier with the Rift, and I find the rift more comfortable to wear (and to remove).
I also find the Rift sits a bit more comfortably when you ride it up to see the real world.

Both headsets, when adjusted correctly, stick to the right place on my face.

## Visual clarity

I personally find the Rift to present a better image, for me. The lens glow artifacts are very noticable
on the Rift, I think more so than the Vive, but I also find that I can look at more of the image in the
Rift without it being blurred. I find the Vive requires me to keep my eyes pretty much facing forward
and I need to move my head to bring things into clarity, whereas the Rift seems to let me look away from
straight forward and still be able to clearly view the image.

This is very subjective, and may well be down to bad adjustments on my part with the Vive - I hope so!

The Vive does have a wider FOV (as many reviewers have noted) and that means the view "feels" bigger.
I find this less beneficial when I try to look at a portion of the image that I can see, and it's really
blurred.

## Tracking accuracy

My seated experience with the Rift has been excellent so far.
