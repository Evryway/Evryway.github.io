Evryway is currently creating virtual and augmented reality prototypes.

The short term goal is to build a multiparticipant holodeck experience,
including environments, voice chat, avatars, motion, controller inputs and interactive
elements.

### What does that even mean?

All will become clear over the coming weeks and months, but if you like Neuromancer
and Snow Crash, you'll love where we're going.

Take a look at the prototypes videos for each step of the process.

### Contact

If you're interested in coming on this journey, say hi! If you'd like something built in VR/AR then get in touch.

## Who are we?

Right now, Evryway is just one guy - and that's [Tim Swan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-swan-14b1b). Tim worked in
the games industry until very recently, holding a variety of positions at EA, Disney, Zynga and more. His most recent
adventure involved setting up [Boss Alien](http://www.bossalien.com) with a bunch of friends, where they created
CSR Racing, a mobile drag racing game with close on 200 million downloads last time he checked. That was awesome fun times.


Now, Tim's looking forward to spending quality time with his family while making cool tech in the garage. It's how the best
dreams always start.
