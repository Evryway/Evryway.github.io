Stuck on this page? please read on!

Evryway Scanner should automatically open up as soon as you see this page. (Sorry if this
page is hanging around in your browser, there's not much I can do about that - you can close this tab whenever you'd like!)

Chrome: please make sure you select the Evryway Scanner app to handle the redirect, if required.

Firefox: please press the tiny Android icon at the end of the redirect URL to handle the redirect,
and then select the Evryway Scanner app, if required. The icon should look something like this:

<img src="/assets/apps/scanner/firefox_uri_auth_redirect_icon.jpg" />

If Scanner doesn't open for you, please contact me and I'll try and help resolve the problem.
